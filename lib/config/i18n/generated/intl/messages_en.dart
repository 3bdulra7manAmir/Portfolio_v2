      "I’m a Junior Flutter Developer passionate about building high-quality, cross-platform mobile applications. I specialize in responsive UI design and have solid experience in state management using BLoC, Cubit, and Riverpod. I’m skilled in leveraging tools like ScreenUtil for responsiveness, Shimmer for skeleton loading, and efficient caching with Hive, SharedPreferences, and GetStorage.\n\nMy expertise also covers Firebase services including Authentication, Google Sign-In, Realtime Database, Cloud Storage, and user registration flows. I integrate theming, localization, image pre-caching, and video handling (with Picture-in-Picture support) to create seamless user experiences. With a strong focus on clean architecture and OOP principles, I ensure scalable, maintainable, and efficient codebases.\n\nBeyond mobile development, I’m passionate about modding the Call of Duty series, exploring its mechanics and creating custom content.
